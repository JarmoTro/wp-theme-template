# Object-oriented WordPress child theme template

If you make child themes often, you might find yourself repetitively integrating basic functionality such as shortcodes and enqueueing assets.

This template is intended to speed up the process of integrating such functionality.

While I try to follow the best practices, this is simply what works for me and is by no means the definitive way to do things.

I also recommend integrating phpDocumentor documentation into these types of projects. You can see a working example of phpDocumentors documentation of this project [here](https://jarmotro.github.io/wp-theme-template-phpdoc/).
